                    <p>
                        I was a student at the university of nairobi persuing tourism and
                        hotel management from 2018-2022 and now i am diversifying by
                        including programming to my potfolio. About me i would like to
                        think of myself as a dog because dogs are loyal , spirited and
                        always full of joy but also they are fierce and agressive when it
                        comes to protecting the things they love
                    </p>
